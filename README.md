	<h1>Seek, a small javascript framework on node.js</h1>
	
	<p>
		Seek is being developed with just one sole purpose: gaining experience with server-side javascript and
		a more deep understanding of current popular MVC web frameworks. The current status is pre-pre-pre alpha :D, making Seek not ready for production.
	</p>
	
	<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
	
	<p>
		Seek is a mixture of functionalities borrowed from some production-ready frameworks(no, not from rails) and currently includes:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Routing(similar to Django and Kohana)</li>
		<li>Basic Controllers and filters</li>
		<li>Views(based on <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs">ejs</a>)</li>
		<li>basic javascript class system</li>
		<li>no global namespace pollution(only one object is global - Packagr, which adds the possibility to load different modules from a specific location)</li>
                <li>Error handling</li>
		<li>and more to come...</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
	
	<p>
		Seek can be installed using npm - for the moment it will only be available from here. When i'll decide that Seek is ready, then it will become available via npm install.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>DEPENDENCIES</h2>

		Seek has the following package dependencies:
